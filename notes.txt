What is HTML?
- Hyper Text Markup Language
- Not Programming Language
- Used to structure content (pages and docs)


How do we write HTML tags?
- Element names are surrounded by angle brackets
- Tag elements usually come in pairs (start and end tag)
- Some tags close themselves
-- Examples:
    <h1>Example</h1>
    <br/> (self-closing tag)
    <br> (is fine with HTML5)
